#### The Spatial Advantage
@css[fragment](Geographers know that where things happen, and the spatial relationships between people, events, and natural phenomena is KEY to understanding them.)

@css[fragment](Digital mapping and spatial thinking are being recognized as an essential component of projects that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.)

### GIS Refresher
> @size[.6em](A geographic information system <GIS> is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing data. Rooted in the science of geography, GIS integrates many types of data. It analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes. ​With this unique capability, GIS reveals deeper insights into data, such as patterns, relationships, and situations—helping users make smarter decisions.)

### GIS and the Humanities  
  
How does GIS fit into humanities research? 
 
- "Digital Humanities" |
- What is Digital Humanities? |
+++

###### Digital Humanities
**A useful definition**
> @size[.6em]("The phrase Digital Humanities… describes not just a collective singular but also the humanities in the plural, able to address and engage disparate subject matters across **media**, language, **location**, and history. But, however heterogeneous, the Digital Humanities is unified by its emphasis on making, connecting, interpreting, and collaborating") 

- <span STYLE = "font-size:.6em">["Digital Humanities"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262018470_Open_Access_Edition.pdf), by Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Presner, Jeffrey Schnapp</span>
+++

**And another...**
> @size[.6em]("DH values collaboration, plurality, investigation of human culture, and the disruption of and reflection on traditional practices...the **use of digital technology for humanities projects changes the user’s experience**. The term “digital humanities” is very broad, and contains multitudes, but examples of “digital humanities” practices might include the **use of existing digital tools for research, to display data in new and revelatory ways, or to bring research to new audiences**.")

- <span STYLE = "font-size:.6em">[THATCamp LAC 2012](http://thatcamp.org/), from a collaborative [Glossary of Digital Humanities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/129_260mbp6C6JaqmylmhMTXA1sv7YYQ0OLsAOAOoCJE/edit?usp=sharing)</span>

### GIS and DH Applications

May be as simple as location mapping...

+++
### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are **lightweight web applications** that mash up interactive GIS **maps**, photos/videos and other **multimedia content**, and text-based **narratives**, to tell a story about places or phenomena that are explicitly located in space and time. 
+++
### What are Story Maps?
> @size[.6em] Story Maps leverage modern web development tools to provide an  **engaging, dynamic user experience** that grounds your story in its **geographic setting**.
+++

### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are hosted applications that live in the cloud through common storymapping platforms like [ESRI Story Maps](https://storymaps.esri.com), or [KnightLab StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) 
+++

### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are **free** and **open source**. Users can download and customize them right from the source code. Most Story Map template source code is hosted on [Github](https://www.google.com/search?q=esri+story+maps+github).

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are an easy and effective way to share research results, fieldwork experiences, student project presentations, or engaged scholarship efforts. 
+++

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps communicate information in an entertaining and engaging way that traditional presentations (posters, web pages, white papers, etc) often lack. 
+++

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] ESRI's Story Maps platform features **responsive** templates that display correctly in all modern web-browsers, including mobile device browsers. They are O/S and browser **agnostic**. 
+++

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] In the classroom, Story Maps make wonderful **group projects**, that help students develop some basic technical skills in **web-based GIS** and **WYSIWYG web development**. 
+++
### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps encourage **critical thinking** and effective communication of data.

+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
<span style="font-size:0.6em">**Feature Layer**: A set of geographic features sharing the same geometry and attributes, hosted in ArcGIS Online.</span>
 
![Feature Layer](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/features-92.jpg)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?

+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Three ways...
- Story Map Builder (Five Minute Story Map)
- Build web map & share as web app (Story Map of Thrones)
- Download and configure (for advanced users)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Know your audience**
- Don't assume they know your intent or how things work. **Explain it**. 
- Keep the language low level. Avoid techno-babble.
- Remember: You won't be there to hold their hand!
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**First impressions count**
- Lead off with a catchy video, image, title, etc.
- Keep them engaged
- You are competing for their attention with the ENTIRE Internet!
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Keep it simple**
- Keep visual clutter to a minimum
- Let the data speak!
- Choose a basemap that emphasizes your data rather than overshadows it.
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Choose your template wisely**
- What is the purpose of your Story Map?
    - Sequential story?
    - Comparing two datasets?
    - List of locations?
- It is difficult to change templates mid-project
