### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are **lightweight web applications** that mash up interactive GIS **maps**, photos/videos and other **multimedia content**, and text-based **narratives**, to tell a story about places or phenomenon that are explicitly located in space and time. 
+++
### What are Story Maps?
> @size[.6em] Story Maps leverage modern web development tools to provide an  **engaging, dynamic user experience** that grounds your story in its **geographic setting**.
@ul
- Everything happens...
- Somewhere!
@ulend
+++
### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are hosted applications that live in the cloud through common storymapping platforms like [ESRI Story Maps](https://storymaps.esri.com), or [KnghtLabs StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) 
+++
### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are **free** and **open source**. Users can download and customize them right from the source code. Most Story Map template source code is hosted on [Github](https://www.google.com/search?q=esri+story+maps+github).

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are an easy and effective way to share research results, fieldwork experiences, student project presentations, or engaged scholarship efforts. 
+++
### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps communicate information in an entertaining and engaging way that traditional presentations (posters, web pages, white papers, etc) often lack. 
+++
### Why use Story Maps?

+++
### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] In the classroom, Story Maps make wonderful **group projects**, that help students develop some basic technical skills in **web-based GIS** and **WYSIWYG web development**. 
+++
### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps encourage **critical thinking** and effective communication of data.

- ~~Why should we use them?~~ 
- **Activity: Check out the Story Maps Gallery** 
- How do we build Story Maps? 
- Some examples

+++
### Activity: Check out the Story Maps Gallery
Take note of...
- **Why** you find it effective (the topic? organization?, multimedia content?)
- **Which** template was used? Tour? Journal? Cascade?
- **How** you might employ a similar map in your own teaching and/or research

### How do we build Story Maps?
Two main Story Map platforms...
- [KnightLab StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)
    - Simple, interactive editing of locations and text
    - Basic interface with limited customizations
- [ESRI Story Maps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com)
    - Runs on ArcGIS Online web GIS 
    - Sophisticated data management tools
    - Template options for custom look and feel
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online
- Cloud-based GIS environment by ESRI
- Store/edit/display/analyze geographic data
- Build **web maps** and **web apps** to **share** with users in an organizations or publicly.
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
**Feature Layer**: Set of geographic features sharing the same geometry and attributes, hosted in ArcGIS Online. 
![Feature Layer](images/link.png)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
**Basemap**: A tiled/slippy map that serves as the background for your Feature Layers
![base map](images/basemap.jpg)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
**Web Map**: A map in AGOL that consumes Feature Layers and basemaps. Full featured environment for data editing, analysis, and visualization.
![Web Map](images/webmap.PNG)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
**Web App**: A front-end “wrapper” that consumes a web map and provides custom functionality to the end user.
![Web App](images/webapp.PNG) 
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
**Story Map**: A web app template that builds narratives around
a set of spatial data. 
![story map](images/storymap.PNG)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Three ways...
- Story Map Builder (Five Minute Story Map)
- Build web map & share as web app (Story Map of Thrones)
- Download and configure (for advanced users)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Know your audience**
- Don't assume they know your intent or how things work. **Explain it**. 
- Keep the language low level. Avoid techno-babble.
- Remember: You won't be there to hold their hand!
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Start with a bang!**
- First impressions count, so lead off with an engaging video, image, title, etc.
- Keep them engaged
- You are competing for their attention with the ENTIRE Internet!
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Visual simplicity rules the day**
- Keep visual clutter to a minimum
- Let the data speak!
- Choose a basemap that emphasizes your data rather than overshadows it.
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Choose your template wisely**
- What is the purpose of your Story Map?
    - Sequential story?
    - Comparing two datasets?
    - List of locations?
- It is difficult to change templates mid-project
- Measure twice, cut once!

1. Concept before compliation
2. Hierarchy with harmony
3. Simplicity from sacrifice
4. Maximum information at minimum costs
5. Engage the emotion to engage the understanding
