#### The Spatial Advantage
@css[fragment](Geographers know that where things happen, and how the locations of different people, events, and natural phenomena relate to each other is KEY to understanding them.)

@css[fragment](Digital mapping and spatial thinking are being recognized as an essential component of projects that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.)

### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are **lightweight web applications** that mash up interactive GIS **maps**, photos/videos and other **multimedia content**, and text-based **narratives**, to tell a story about places or phenomena that are explicitly located in space and time. 
+++
### What are Story Maps?
> @size[.6em] Story Maps leverage modern web development tools to provide an  **engaging, dynamic user experience** that grounds your story in its **geographic setting**.
+++

### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are hosted applications that live in the cloud through common storymapping platforms like [ESRI Story Maps](https://storymaps.esri.com), or [KnightLab StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) 
+++

### What are Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are **free** and **open source**. Users can download and customize them right from the source code. Most Story Map template source code is hosted on [Github](https://www.google.com/search?q=esri+story+maps+github).

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are an easy and effective way to share research results, fieldwork experiences, student project presentations, or engaged scholarship efforts. 
+++

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps communicate information in an entertaining and engaging way that traditional presentations (posters, web pages, white papers, etc) often lack. 
+++

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] ESRI's Story Maps platform features **responsive** templates that display correctly in all modern web-browsers, including mobile device browsers. They are O/S and browser **agnostic**. 
+++

### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] In the classroom, Story Maps make wonderful **group projects**, that help students develop some basic technical skills in **web-based GIS** and **WYSIWYG web development**. 
+++
### Why use Story Maps? 
> @size[.6em] Story Maps encourage **critical thinking** and effective communication of data.

+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
<span style="font-size:0.6em">**Feature Layer**: A set of geographic features sharing the same geometry and attributes, hosted in ArcGIS Online.</span>
 
![Feature Layer](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/features-92.jpg)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
<span style="font-size:0.6em">**Basemap**: A static tiled map that serves as the background for your Feature Layers</span>

![base map](images/basemap.jpg)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
<span style="font-size:0.6em">**Web Map**: A map in AGOL that consumes Feature Layers and basemaps. Fully featured environment for data editing, analysis, and visualization.</span>

![Web Map](images/webmap.PNG)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### ArcGIS Online Key Terms
<span style="font-size:0.6em">**Web App**: A front-end “wrapper” that consumes a web map and provides a curated experience and select functionality to the end user.</span>

![Web App](images/webapp.PNG) 
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?

<span style="font-size:0.6em">**Story Map**: A web app template that builds narratives around
a set of spatial data, text, and multimedia content.</span> 

![story map](images/storymap.PNG)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Three ways...
- Story Map Builder (Five Minute Story Map)
- Build web map & share as web app (Story Map of Thrones)
- Download and configure (for advanced users)
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Know your audience**
- Don't assume they know your intent or how things work. **Explain it**. 
- Keep the language low level. Avoid techno-babble.
- Remember: You won't be there to hold their hand!
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**First impressions count**
- Lead off with a catchy video, image, title, etc.
- Keep them engaged
- You are competing for their attention with the ENTIRE Internet!
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Keep it simple**
- Keep visual clutter to a minimum
- Let the data speak!
- Choose a basemap that emphasizes your data rather than overshadows it.
+++
### How do we build Story Maps?
##### Guiding Principles
**Choose your template wisely**
- What is the purpose of your Story Map?
    - Sequential story?
    - Comparing two datasets?
    - List of locations?
- It is difficult to change templates mid-project
